# Blazor-Information-Dashboard

# Purpose
This project is a learning experience designed to test the capability of the Blazor server software and how it handles WebAssembly. This project uses a C# backend and an HTML/CSS frontend with combined C# WebAssembly.

# Building
This project was programmed with Visual Studio 2022, and hence requires all of the dependencies associated with .NET development on it.

# Project Dependencies
- .NET 7 Framework

# Credits
- Microsoft's Blazor Framework and boilerplate code

Also a MASSIVE thank you to Microsoft for producing Visual Studio Community 2022, as this project wouldn't exist without it!
